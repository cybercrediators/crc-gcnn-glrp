# Performance comparison/stats
## Training
+ Spektral vs. original implementation
  + AUC, Accuracy, (F1, Recall, Precision)
  + Timings
  + Different networks

## Layer-Wise relevance propagation
This shouldn't be much different, since the implementation is the one from the paper -> no surprises expected.
